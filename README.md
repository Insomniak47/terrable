# Terrable

Terrable is just a tiny project to let me do version switching when doing terraform related stuff in pwsh (we exist).

## Alternatives

If you're using bash or you want a larger featureset or you don't like Microsoft then you'll probably want to take a peek at the much more featured [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) those folks have done a great job if you use a linux shell.

## Compatibility

I'm working on getting a test environment up and running for osx and for linux environments. The goal will be to support the intersection of what terraform and dotnet core support.

## Contributing

Toss in a PR and I'll definitely take a look. Fork, do whatever!
